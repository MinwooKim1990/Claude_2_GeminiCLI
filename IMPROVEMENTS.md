# Gemini MCP Server v1.4.0 Improvements

Based on feedback from testing, I've implemented the following improvements to make the MCP server more useful than direct tmux usage:

## ‚úÖ Implemented Features

### 1. Enhanced Response Detection (Improvement #1)
- Added comprehensive regex patterns for various Gemini response formats
- Detects box content, code blocks, list items, and more
- Better handling of multi-line responses and formatted content

### 2. Debug Mode (Improvement #10)
- All tools now support a `debug` parameter
- Returns detailed execution information including:
  - Raw tmux output
  - Commands executed
  - Timing information
  - Session state
- Helps troubleshoot issues without direct tmux access

### 3. File Context Support (Improvement #8)
- Implemented @filename preprocessing
- Automatically expands relative paths to absolute paths
- Verifies file existence before sending
- Example: `@package.json explain this` ‚Üí `@/full/path/to/package.json explain this`

### 4. Enhanced Session Status (Improvement #5)
- Shows detailed session information:
  - Current state (idle, processing, searching, waiting_permission)
  - Message count in conversation
  - Session creation time
  - Pane size and attachment status
- Configurable output lines or full session history

### 5. Better Error Handling (Improvement #6)
- Provides helpful error suggestions
- Detects common issues (tmux not installed, session problems)
- More descriptive error messages

### 6. Smart Permission Handling (Improvement #4)
- Improved auto_permission parameter functionality
- Better detection of permission prompts
- More reliable automatic responses

## üöß Partially Implemented

### Status Information (Improvement #3)
- We now parse and display Gemini's status indicators
- Limited by what Gemini actually shows in output
- Provides state information in session status tool

## ‚ùå Not Feasible with MCP Architecture

### 1. Streaming Responses (Improvement #2)
- MCP follows request-response pattern
- Cannot provide real-time streaming
- Alternative: Use debug mode to see progress

### 2. Async Task Tracking (Improvement #9)
- MCP is stateless by design
- Cannot track tasks across multiple calls
- Alternative: Use session status to check ongoing work

### 3. Conversation Context Management (Improvement #7)
- No persistent storage in MCP
- Context exists only within tmux session
- Alternative: Gemini maintains context within session

## Summary

The improvements focus on what's architecturally possible with MCP while providing real value:

1. **Better Detection**: More reliable response capture
2. **Debugging Support**: Transparency into what's happening
3. **File Integration**: Seamless file references
4. **Enhanced Monitoring**: Detailed session information
5. **Improved UX**: Better errors and smart defaults

These changes make the MCP server more practical for real-world use, even with the inherent limitations of the MCP protocol.
